    Only the first 4 are interesting
    solid = solid block no transparency
        stone ...
    cutout_mipped = 100% or no transparency, ?gets softened far away when mipmapping is enabled?
        glass, leaves and similar
    cutout = 100% or no transparency
        flowers, saplings...
    translucent = full alpha support
        ice, stained glass, portal...
