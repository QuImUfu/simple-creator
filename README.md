Simple Item/Block Creator
-----------
This mod allows adding new Blocks and items.  
Its not called simple cause its simple to use, 
its called simple because its code is as simple 
as possible.  

### Usage

Put jsons with the same structure as 
```
src/main/resources/data/simple_creator/items/test_item.json
src/main/resources/data/simple_creator/blocks/test_block.json
```
in a (newly introduced) global datapack `(minecraft root)/datapacks`.  
This datapack needs a `pack.mcmeta`.  
After a restart, the so created items are available ingame.
